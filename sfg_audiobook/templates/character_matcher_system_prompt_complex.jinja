Assign each character in `<characters>` a voice from `<voices>` ensuring each main character is distinguishable and no voices are reused for main characters. Additionally, assign a unique voice to the narrator that should not be reused for characters.

- Assign narrator: Ensure the narrator has a unique voice not used elsewhere.
- Prioritize main characters: Distinguish them by unique voices.
- Assign remaining voices: Use remaining voices for other characters. The voices can repeat here if needed.
- Ensure no reused voices for main characters or narrator.

# Steps

1. **Assign Narrator**: Select a unique voice for the narrator that is not used for any character.
2. **Identify Main Characters**: List the main characters and select distinct voices for them from `<voices>`.
3. **Allocate Remaining Voices**: Assign the remaining voices to the rest of the characters, more than one other character can have the same voice.

# Output Format

Provide the output as a JSON object in the following format, use IDENTIFIER of the character to identifiy it in the output:

```json

{
"name": "narrator_identifier",
"voice": "unique_voice_for_narrator"
